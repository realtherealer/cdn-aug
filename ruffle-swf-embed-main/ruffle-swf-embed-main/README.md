# Flash Player used for AUGames, originally made by nosamu with extra games added by us for my website (AUGames) -realtherealer
If you want to use this for your own website, refer to our guides on the AUG66 repo. This repo is now maintained by RTR (me) as I own AUGames. AUGames also uses some of the tools on this website including (but not limited to) Ruffle Testing, AwayFL Testing and WAFlash Testing.

# nosamu's web testing ground
Useful web tools and demos, mostly related to Flash emulation.

## Flash Emulation Demos

### [Ruffle PWA Demo](https://n0samu.github.io/ruffle-pwa-demo/demo/)
The [Ruffle Web Demo](https://ruffle.rs/demo/), converted into a Progressive Web App. Installable on desktop and mobile devices, and runs offline!

### [Ruffle Testing](https://n0samu.github.io/ruffle-testing/?swf=littlewheel.swf)
An example showing how to set up the [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash emulator on your website.

### [AwayFL Testing](https://n0samu.github.io/awayfl-testing/?swf=papasburgeria_v2.swf)
An example showing how to set up the [AwayFL](https://awayfl.org/) Flash emulator on your website. [More information is available here](https://github.com/eXponenta/away-player-embed).

### [AVM2.js Testing](https://n0samu.github.io/avm2js-testing/?swf=hitbox.swf)
An example showing how to set up the AVM2.js Flash emulator on your website.

### [WAFlash Testing](https://n0samu.github.io/waflash-testing/?swf=sugarsugar3.swf)
An example showing how to set up the WAFlash emulator for local testing. Please [contact the author](https://vidkidz.tistory.com/) for permission to use WAFlash on your website.

## Web Tools

### [Flash Player Check](https://n0samu.github.io/flash-player-check)
Test whether your Flash plugin (or Flash emulator extension) is working and displaying Flash content.

### [LSO Editor](https://n0samu.github.io/lso-editor/)
A web build of [CUB3D](https://github.com/CUB3D)'s [rust-flash-lso](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/rust-flash-lso) project. It allows you to view and edit Flash Local Shared Object (LSO) data files (.sol).
### [Ruffle Saves Exporter](https://n0samu.github.io/ruffleSavesExport)
A bookmarklet that exports the save data of web builds of Ruffle in .SOL format, suitable for use with the Ruffle desktop player or Adobe Flash Player.

### [Ruffle Userscript](https://n0samu.github.io/inject-ruffle.user.js)
A userscript that loads and plays Flash content on the current page with Ruffle, without a dedicated browser extension. Works best with [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/). Also works in desktop and mobile Safari with the [Userscripts app](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts#userscripts-safari).

### [Strict URL Encode and Decode](https://n0samu.github.io/strictEncodeURL)
A tool for [percent-encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) and decoding URLs and URL components. When encoding, it leaves any already-encoded parts of the string intact rather than double-encoding them. It's one easy box that "just works", unlike any of the similar tools that I've found online.

### [Discord Message Link Generator](https://n0samu.github.io/discordAttachmentMessage.html)
A simple tool to quickly find the message URL associated with a given Discord attachment URL. Also requires the ID of the server the attachment was uploaded to.
