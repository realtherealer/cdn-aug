# This is where all game files are stored, ruffle will grab game files from here during boot and look for the specified game name. If its not here, the emulator will hang indefinately.

Uploading games for ruffle:
1. Upload the .swf file into this directory. (only Shockwave Flash files are supported)
2. In the ruffle URL you can now specify ruffle to look for the file, once found it will boot properly.
